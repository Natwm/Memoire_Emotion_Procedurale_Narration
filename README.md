# Endverdens - A Procedurally Generated Rogue-lite Adventure

## Overview

**Endverdens** is more than just a game; it's a narrative experiment in procedural design and emotional engagement. Developed as a collaborative project by three Masterâ€™s students in Game Design, this rogue-lite adventure invites you to explore a mysterious mansion, where each decision shapes the story, and no two playthroughs are the same.

In **Endverdens**, you lead a team of four characters, guiding them through treacherous halls using vignettes that represent their actions. Each item, each choice, and each step forward can mean the difference between survival and demise. How will you distribute the scarce resources among your team? Will your decisions bring them closer together, or push them to the brink?

This project isn't just a gameâ€”it's a living, breathing thesis on how gameplay can drive narrative, how procedural elements can craft unique experiences, and how emotional design can deepen player immersion.
